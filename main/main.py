# TODO: Sketch out the program flow (This is not final)
# 1. Get the user's name
# 2. Create a valid sudoku grid composed of a CONTAINER, GRID, and TILES (Tiles are inside GRID)
# 3. Remove 1 inner 2x2 (Henceforth referred to as GRID) tile to enable sliding
# 4. Create a valid killer grid (The one that shows the sums for the valid sudoku grid)
# 5. Randomize the 3 remaining 2x2 tiles position in reference to the outer 2x2 container (Henceforth referred to as CONTAINER)
# 6. Following a set of rules as to not leave the puzzle unsolvable, remove number from the GRIDs
# 7. Display the CONTAINER and GRID to the user, overlap the KILLER GRID on top of the CONTAINER
# 8. Enable the user to slide the GRID tiles
# 8. Get the user's input
# 9. Check if the user's CONTAINER matches the originally generated CONTAINER
# 10. If correct, say YOU WIN, else: do not end the game, the user is able to remove only tiles they have places
